  GDS standard is to use warning for legal warning. Our use was not correct.

  Add WAMITAB qualifications to the upload screen

  Link directly to FPP guidance and remove short form of guidance
</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>
  Short guidance did not test well with users as it was too short and longer detailed guidance has recently been updated so seem best to link to that. We need to test fire prevention plan guidance in beta.

<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>
  Remove option to search on company name
</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>
  Evidence from the flood risk project suggests that most users know how to find the company number. A number search will produce simpler results compared with a free text search (as few users will get the company name correct) so it will be easier to use in the end.

 so that I can report on applications by agents
