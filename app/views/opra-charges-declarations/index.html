<!-- 1. Working out charges -->

<h1 class="heading-large">Working out charges</h1>

<p>You have to submit an application fee with your application. You can find out the charge by searching for ‘Environment Agency charging scheme and guidance: environmental permits, licence and registration costs and fees’ at www.gov.uk/environment-agency.</p>
<p>Please remember that the charges are revised on 1 April each year and that there is an annual subsistence charge to cover the costs we incur in the ongoing regulation of the permit.</p>

<p>Note: for Opra charged Tier 3 Facilities you also need to complete an Opra profile (see section 2).</p>
