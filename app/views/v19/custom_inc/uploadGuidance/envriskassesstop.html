<h2 class="heading-small">How to write the risk assessment</h2>
<p>
  Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/technical-guidance-for-regulated-industry-sectors-environmental-permitting" target="_blank">technical guidance (opens new tab)</a> for each activity you are applying for. Once you have worked through the relevant technical guidance, you will have developed a full set of proposals for your intended operations, including the nature, quantities and sources of your foreseeable emissions to air, water and land.
</p>
<p>
  You should now describe the environmental risk posed by your proposals. This must take the form of an environmental risk assessment which should follow the methodology set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/risk-assessments-for-your-environmental-permit" target="_blank">risk assessments for your environmental permit (opens in new tab)</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Where you wish to use a different methodology, that methodology must address the same issues to an equivalent level of detail. The purpose of the environmental risk assessment is to demonstrate that the impacts of your proposals will be acceptable.
